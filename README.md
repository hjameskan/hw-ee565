## Projects

### Project 1: HTTP Pseudo Streaming

- **Deadline**: Jan 21, 2023. 11:59 PM PST
- **Description**: This project focuses on the implementation of a simple HTTP server. The server acts as a basic file server, capable of serving various content types like HTML, images, audio, video, etc., based on the resource identifier (URI). For more details, check the [Project 1 directory](./hw1/README.md).

---

### Project 2: Transport System

- **Deadline**: Feb 4, 2023. 11:59 PM PST
- **Description**: Building upon the previous project, this part extends the initial HTTP server with an additional transport layer. This layer facilitates file transfers between multiple peer nodes in a P2P network. The backend transport protocol is designed to operate over UDP and incorporates concepts from the transport and datalink layers. For an in-depth understanding, visit the [Project 2 directory](./hw2/README.md).

### Project 3: Peer Network

- **Deadline**: Feb 18, 2023. 11:59 PM PST
- **Description**: This project dives deeper into the P2P network system. It involves the creation of a link-state routing protocol for the network. The primary objective is to leverage the derived distance metric to enhance transport efficiency. Additionally, various extra achievements and credit features like active distance metrics, extended neighbors, and transport integration are incorporated. For a detailed overview, navigate to the [Project 3 directory](./hw3/README.md).

### Project 4: Content Search

- **Deadline**: Mar 4, 2023. 11:59 PM PST
- **Description**: The final project revolves around the development of a gossip protocol that conducts a distributed content search. The project supports features like partial content matching and provides a user-friendly content portal that showcases the latest content available on the P2P network. To delve into the specifics, please visit the [Project 4 directory](./hw4/README.md).
